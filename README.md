## 4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) - Chromatin Tracing (CT)

This document describes the **4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) - Chromatin Tracing (CT)**, a community data format designed for capturing and exchanging the results of FISH-omics experiments produced within the context of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) project.

The format consists of a series of ten tables with different requirement degrees.
The full list of tables and instructions on how to use them can be found at: https://fish-omics-format.readthedocs.io/.

The image below gives a schematic view of the 12 FOF-CT tables indicating whether they are **required** (**triple line**), *conditionally required* (*double line*), or optional/recommended content (single line).
