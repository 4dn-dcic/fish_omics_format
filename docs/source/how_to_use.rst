Downloadable Templates
======================
To facilitate adoption of the FOF-CT format, table Templates can be dowloaded from `here <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fish_omics_format/releases/latest>`_.

These templates can be used as a starting point for filling in all the required :ref:`headers-reference-label` lines and :ref:`columns-reference-label`.

.. tip:: The 4DN Data Portal only accepts GRCh38 for human and GRCm38 for mouse. For other species follow these `instructions. <https://data.4dnucleome.org/search/?type=Organism>`_ In addition, in case the genome under study contains INSERTION/DELETIONs follow also these :ref:`IN_DEL-reference-label`.

The following is a short step-by-step description of how to use these templates:

#. Download the Templates package
#. Select the templates for the tables to be utilized and save them locally in CSV or in one of the other allowable tabular formats.
#. Fill in all indicated values in the Header section of each template
#. Cut and paste the data columns below the Header section in a comma-separated format.
#. Save the filled in templates in the same format described in Point 2.
#. Follow the instructions of your data curator for uploading and sharing.
