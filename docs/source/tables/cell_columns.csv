**Cell_ID**,This fields reports the unique identifier for Region of Interest (ROI) that represent the boundaries of a Cell identified as part of this experiment. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots or Traces that are part of the same Cell.,1,
*Extra_Cell_ROI_ID*,In case multiple Cells are localized within a given extracellular structure (e.g. Tissue) Region of Interest (ROI): this fields reports the unique identifier that allows to identify such as ROI. Note: this is used to connect individual Cells that are part of the same extracellular ROI.,1,Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if data in this table can be associated with an extracellular ROI identified as part of this experiment.
