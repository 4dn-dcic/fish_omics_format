*Sub_Cell_ROI_ID*,"This fields reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a sub-cellular structure identified as part of this experiment. Note: this is used to connect all Spots, and Traces that belong to the same ROI.",1,Conditional requirement: This table must have at least one of the ID columns. Sub_Cell_ROI_ID MUST be reported if this table contains subcellular ROI data
*Cell_ID*,This fields reports the unique identifier for Region of Interest (ROI) that represent the boundaries of a Cell identified as part of this experiment. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots or Traces that are part of the same Cell.,1,Conditional requirement: This table must have at least one of the ID columns. Cell_ID MUST be reported if this table contains Cell data
*Extra_Cell_ROI_ID*,"This fields reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a extracellular structure (e.g., Tissue) identified as part of this experiment. Note: this is used to connect all Spots, and Traces that belong to the same ROI.",1,Conditional requirement: This table must have at least one of the ID columns. Extra_Cell_ROI_ID MUST be reported if this table contains extracellular ROI data.
