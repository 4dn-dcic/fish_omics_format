**Spot_ID**,A unique identifier for this bright DNA Spot.,1,,
**Trace_ID**,"In **ball-and-stick** Chromatin Tracing experiments, tracing algorithms are used to interlink individual DNA Spots in 3D polymeric traces delineating the conformation of chromatin fibers (such as in `ORCA <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-00478-x>`_). As such, this fields reports a unique identifier for the Trace each Spot belongs to. **Note**: The purpose of this field is to connect Spots that are part of the same polymeric Trace. It is also used to connect individual Traces recorded in this table with global Trace properties reported elsewhere in the dataset (i.e., :ref:`trace` and :ref:`rna`).",1,,
**X**,The sub-pixel X coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported X position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing correction procedures (i.e. drift correction; chromatic correction etc).,14.43,,
**Y**,The sub-pixel Y coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Y position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing correction procedures (i.e. drift correction; chromatic correction etc).,41.43,,
**Z**,The sub-pixel Z coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Z position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing correction procedures (i.e. drift correction; chromatic correction etc).,1.23,,
**Chrom**,Chromosome name. Because BED (Browser Extensible Data) is the de facto exchange bioinformatics format for genomic data; the BED terminology was used here.,chr3; chrY; chr2_random,,
**Chrom_Start**,Start coordinate on the Chromosome for the sequence associated with this bright Spot (the first base on the chromosome is numbered 0). Because BED (Browser Extensible Data) is the de facto exchange bioinformatics format for genomic data; the BED terminology was used here.,0,,
**Chrom_End**,Stop coordinate on the Chromosome for the sequence associated with this bright Spot. This position is non-inclusive; unlike Chrom_Start. Because BED (Browser Extensible Data) is the de facto exchange bioinformatics format for genomic data; the BED terminology was used here.,1000,,
*Sub_Cell_ROI_ID*,If known; this field reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a sub-cellular structure a given Spot/Trace is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spot/Traces that are part of the same ROI. It is also used to connect data in this table with any ROI specific measurements such as boundaries; intensities or volume; recorded in the corresponding Sub-Cell ROI Data table.,1,Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if Sub-cellular structures (e.g.; Nucleus; Nucleolus etc.) were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Sub-Cell ROI Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Sub_Cell_ROIs.
*Cell_ID*,"If known, this field reports the unique identifier for the Cell a given Spot/Trace is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spot/Traces that are part of the same Cell. It is also used to connect data in this table with any Cell specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding Cell Data table.",1,"Conditional requirement: This column is mandatory if Cells were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Cell Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Cells.",
*Extra_Cell_ROI_ID*,"If known, this field reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a extracellular structure (e.g., Tissue) a given Spot/Trace is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spot/Traces that are part of the same ROI. It is also used to connect data in this table with any ROI specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding Extra-Cell ROI Data table.",1,"Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if Extracellular structures (e.g., Tissue, etc.) were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Extra-Cell ROI Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Extra_Cell_ROIs.",
