This description should provide a detailed understanding of the algortithm and of the analysis parameters that were used, in order to guarantee interpretation and reproducibility.","ChrTracer3 software was developed for analysis of raw DNA labeled images. As an input, it takes an.xlsx table containing information and folder names of the DNA experiment. As an output, it returns tab delimited.txt Ô¨Åles with drift-corrected x, y, z positions for all labeled barcodes. These can be used directly to calculate the nm scale distances between all pairs of labeled loci. The current version of the software as of this writing is ChrTracer3.",
