Name,Description,Example,Conditional requirement conditions
**RNA_Spot_ID**,A unique identifier for this bright Spot.,1,
**X**,"The sub-pixel X coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported X position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).",14.43,
**Y**,"The sub-pixel Y coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Y position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).",14.43,
**Z**,"The sub-pixel Z coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Z position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).",1.23,
**RNA_Name**,This is the official name of the Gene the targeted RNA is transcribed from.,ACTB,
**Gene_ID**,This is the official ID for the Gene encoding for the targeted RNA transcript.,ENSG00000075624,
*Transcript_ID*,This is the official ID for the targeted RNA transcript. This field is required in case the same Gene has multiple different Transcripts and the FISH probe used in this case is capable of distinguishing between them.,ENST00000646664.1,Conditional requirement: this MUST be reported if multiple transcripts are associated with the same Gene_ID and the FISH probes are capable of distinguishing them.
**Trace_ID**,"This fields reports the unique identifier for a DNA Trace identified as part of this experiment. **Note**: The purpose of this field is to associate the location of individual RNA Spots (i.e., nascent RNA transcript) recorded in this table, with the corresponding Trace recorded in the :ref:`core`, and with global Trace properties recorded in the :ref:`trace`.",1,
*Sub_Cell_ROI_ID*,-------,1,"Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if Sub-cellular structures (e.g., Nucleus, Nucleolus etc.) were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Sub-Cell ROI Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Sub_Cell_ROIs."
*Cell_ID*,"If known, this fields reports the unique identifier for the Cell a given Spot is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots that are part of the same Cell. It is also used to connect data in this table with any Cell specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding Cell Data table.",1,"Conditional requirement: This column is mandatory if Cells were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Cell Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Cells."
*Extra_Cell_ROI_ID*,"If known, this fields reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a extracellular structure (e.g., Tissue) a given Spot is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots that are part of the same ROI. It is also used to connect data in this table with any ROI specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding Extra-Cell ROI Data table.",1,"Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if Extracellular structures (e.g., Tissue, etc.) were identified as part of this experiment and were reported in a dedicated Extra-Cell ROI Data table, and if data in this table can be associated with individual Extra_Cell_ROIs."
