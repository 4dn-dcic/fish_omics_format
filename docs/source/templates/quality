[Choose one or more of the following conditionally required columns]
#^Centroid_Intensity: The signal intensity of the pixel occupying the center-of-mass within a bright Spot (i.e. centroid).
#^Peak_Intensity: The signal intensity of the brightest pixel within a bright Spot (i.e. local maximum).
#^Raw_X: the original fit x-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations. 
#^Raw_Y: the original fit y-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations. 
#^Raw_Z: the original fit z-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations. 
#^X_Drift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in x based on fiducial tracking
#^Y_Drift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in y based on fiducial tracking
#^Z_Drift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in z based on fiducial tracking
#^X_Chromatic_Shift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in x based on chromatic correction map
#^Y_Chromatic_Shift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in y based on chromatic correction map
#^Z_Chromatic_Shift: the distance in nm the spot was moved in z based on chromatic correction map
#^X_Loc_Precision: lower and upper bound of 95% confidence interval on X-position after fit
#^Y_Loc_Precision: lower and upper bound of 95% confidence interval on Y-position after fit
#^Z_Loc_Precision: lower and upper bound of 95% confidence interval on Z-position after fit
